# Obsidian `@People`

Obsidian plugin to add that familiar @-to-tag-someone syntax:

![](./example.png)

When you hit enter on a suggestion, it'll create a link that looks like this:

```
The author was [[@Rich Hickey]]
```

and leave the cursor at the end.

> **Maintenance Transfer**: This is now the actively maintained version of the At-People plugin, with permission from the original creator [Tobias Davis (saibotsivad)](https://github.com/saibotsivad). The [original repository](https://github.com/saibotsivad/obsidian-at-people) has been archived as of October 2025. We're grateful to Tobias for creating this plugin and for entrusting the community with its continued development.

## Search Features

This plugin includes intelligent fuzzy search with the following capabilities:

- **Accent-insensitive**: Search for "martin" and find "Martín García"
- **Case-insensitive**: "JOHN" matches "John Doe"
- **Substring matching**: "rich" matches "Rich Hickey" or "Rich Harris"
- **Multi-word search**: "juan car" matches "Juan Carlos"
- **Initials matching**: "jc" matches "Juan Carlos"
- **Word-start matching**: "mar" matches "Juan Martinez"
- **Smart ranking**: Results are prioritized by:
  - Exact matches at name start (highest priority)
  - Matches at word boundaries
  - Number of backlinks (frequently referenced people rank higher)

**Note**: The search only returns contiguous matches. Searching "lun" will NOT match "Laura Undurry Navaez" (non-contiguous letters).

## Configuration Options

The plugin offers several configuration options to customize behavior:

### 1. Where are the people files?

You probably want to group the people files in a folder.

I usually do something like this:

```
People/
	@Rich Hickey.md
	@Rich Harris.md
```

You can configure that in settings to point to somewhere else, like `Reference/People/` or whatever makes sense.

### 2. Explicit link structure?

By default, the plugin will insert the simple version:

```
[[@Rich Hickey]]
```

But you might rather make that explicit, in which case you can enable "explicit links" and they'll look like this instead:

```
[[People/@Rich Hickey.md|@Rich Hickey]]
```

### 3. Folder Mode

You can store the people in three different ways using the dropdown.

#### Default

This setting is the default. It creates a single file per person.

Example:

```
People/
	@Rich Hickey.md
	@Rich Harris.md
```

And then the inserted link would look like:

```
[[People/@Rich Hickey.md|@Rich Hickey]]
or if explicit link is disabled
[[@Rich Hickey]]
```

#### Per Person

This setting will create a directory per person. You can use it to store multiple notes related to the same person. It requires "Explicit link" to be enabled.

Example:

```
People/
	@Rich Hickey/
		@Rich Hickey.md
		more-files.md
	@Rich Harris/
		@Rich Harris.md
		more-files.md
```

And then the inserted link would look like:

```
[[People/@Rich Hickey/@Rich Hickey.md|@Rich Hickey]]
```

#### Per Lastname

This setting will create a directory per lastname and a single file for the person itself. You can e.g. use it if you have many people sharing the same lastname. It requires "Explicit link" to be enabled.

Example:

```
People/
	Hickey/
		@Rich Hickey.md
	Harris/
		@Rich Harris.md
```

And then the inserted link would look like:

```
[[People/Hickey/@Rich Hickey.md|@Rich Hickey]]
```

> Note: figuring out what the "last name" is (or if it even has one) is really complicated! This plugin takes a very simple approach: if you split a name by the space character, it'll just pick the last "word". So for example "Charles Le Fabre" would be "Fabre" and *not* "Le Fabre".

> I'm open to better implementations that don't add a lot of complexity, just start a discussion.

### 4. Auto-create files

When enabled, the plugin will automatically create person files and the necessary folders when you select a person suggestion. This works seamlessly with all folder modes:

- **Default mode**: Creates the file directly in the People folder
- **Per Person mode**: Creates a folder for the person and the file inside it
- **Per Lastname mode**: Creates a folder for the lastname and the file inside it

If this setting is disabled (default), you need to manually create the person files yourself.

## Technical Features

### Performance
- Results are limited to top 20 suggestions to maintain responsiveness
- Backlink counts are only calculated for matching results (not all people)
- Efficient in-memory caching of person files

### Smart Ranking Algorithm
The plugin uses a sophisticated scoring system that combines:
- **Pattern matching score** (800-3000 points):
  - Exact match at name start: 3000 pts
  - Match at word boundary: 2500 pts
  - Multi-word pattern match: 1500 pts
  - Word initials match: 1000 pts
  - Word start match: 800 pts
- **Backlink boost** (0-460+ points):
  - Logarithmic scale based on reference frequency
  - 1 backlink ≈ 69 pts
  - 10 backlinks ≈ 230 pts
  - 100 backlinks ≈ 460 pts

This ensures frequently-used people appear higher in suggestions while maintaining relevance to your search query.
